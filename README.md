Don't Fallacy Me is a free, collaborative, multiplayer mind game! It provides an example, and you select the clearest 
logical fallacy. A fallacy is, very generally, an error in reasoning. This differs from a factual error, which is 
simply being wrong about the facts.  The Don't Fallacy Me database has been rebuilt using 
<a href="https://github.com/wikiworldorder/survloop" target="_blank">SurvLoop</a>, a 
<a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel</a>-based engine for designing a 
database and creating a mobile-friendly user interface to fill it.

# <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started

The instructions below include the needed steps to install Laravel, SurvLoop, as well as the Don't Fallacy Me system.
For more on creating environments to host Laravel, you can find more instructions on
<a href="https://survloop.org/how-to-install-laravel-on-a-digital-ocean-server" target="_blank">SurvLoop.org</a>.

* Use Composer to install Laravel with default user authentication, one required package:

```
$ composer global require "laravel/installer"
$ composer create-project laravel/laravel Fallacy "5.7.*"
$ cd Fallacy
$ php artisan make:auth
$ php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-notifications
```

* Update `composer.json` to add requirements and an easier Don't Fallacy Me reference:

```
$ nano composer.json
```

```
...
"require": {
	...
    "wikiworldorder/fallacy": "0.*",
	...
},
...
"autoload": {
	...
	"psr-4": {
		...
		"Fallacy\\": "vendor/wikiworldorder/fallacy/src/",
	}
	...
},
...
```

```
$ composer update
```

* Add the package to your application service providers in `config/app.php`.

```
$ nano config/app.php
```

```php
...
'providers' => [
	...
	SurvLoop\SurvLoopServiceProvider::class,
	Fallacy\FallacyServiceProvider::class,
	...
],
...
'aliases' => [
	...
	'SurvLoop'	 => 'WikiWorldOrder\SurvLoop\SurvLoopFacade',
	'Fallacy'	 => 'WikiWorldOrder\Fallacy\FallacyFacade',
	...
],
...
```

* Swap out the SurvLoop user model in `config/auth.php`.

```
$ nano config/auth.php
```

```php
...
'model' => App\Models\User::class,
...
```

* Update composer, publish the package migrations, etc...

```
$ php artisan vendor:publish --force
$ php artisan migrate
$ composer dump-autoload
$ php artisan db:seed --class=SurvLoopSeeder
$ php artisan db:seed --class=FallacySeeder
```

* For now, to apply database design changes to the same installation you are working in, depending on your server, 
you might also need something like this...

```
$ chown -R www-data:33 app/Models
$ chown -R www-data:33 database
```

* Browse to load the style sheets, etc.. /dashboard/css-reload

* Log into Don't Fallacy Me admin dashboard...

```
user: open@dontfallacy.me
password: Fallacy
```

Once installed, documentation of this system's database design can be found at /dashboard/db/all . This system's user 
experience design for data entry can be found at /dashboard/tree/map?all=1&alt=1 .


# <a name="roadmap"></a>Roadmap

Here's the TODO list for the next release (**1.0**). It's my first time building on Laravel, or GitHub. So sorry.

* [ ] Code commenting, learning and implementing more community standards.
* [ ] Correct collection of issues still on my list.
* [ ] Adding unit testing.
* [ ] Basic database design and user experience processes are generated by SurvLoop itself. 
* [ ] Finish migrating all queries to use Laravel's process.
